generations:
  - name: "First Generation (ET/TA)"
    start_year: 1988
    end_year: 1998
    description: "The first-generation Suzuki Vitara (marketed as the Escudo in Japan and Sidekick in some markets) pioneered the compact SUV segment with a design that combined off-road capability with more car-like dimensions and handling than traditional utility vehicles. Initially available as a short-wheelbase three-door convertible or hardtop, with a longer five-door variant added later, the original Vitara featured a distinctive boxy design with round headlights and a spare tire mounted on the rear door. Built on a proper ladder frame chassis with part-time four-wheel drive featuring a two-speed transfer case, the Vitara offered genuine off-road capability uncommon in its size class. Engine options varied by market and over the production run but typically included 1.6-liter and later 1.8-liter and 2.0-liter gasoline engines, with some markets also receiving diesel options. Transmission choices included five-speed manual and four-speed automatic, with selectable four-wheel drive. The interior was functional and straightforward with a focus on durability rather than luxury, though higher trim levels offered improved materials and additional features. This generation established the Vitara as a practical compromise between traditional off-roaders and passenger cars, appealing to buyers seeking outdoor lifestyle capabilities without the size, cost, and compromised on-road manners of larger SUVs. The model achieved particular success in developing markets where its combination of durability, off-road capability, and relatively accessible pricing proved especially valuable."

  - name: "Second Generation (TD/TA/TL)"
    start_year: 1998
    end_year: 2005
    description: "The second-generation Suzuki Vitara, often marketed as the Grand Vitara to distinguish it from the continuing first-generation model in some markets, represented a significant evolution with more sophisticated styling, improved on-road performance, and enhanced refinement. Available in three-door and five-door body styles, this generation featured more rounded, contemporary styling while maintaining clear visual connections to its predecessor. A key mechanical change was the adoption of a monocoque body with integrated ladder frame, combining elements of both unibody and body-on-frame construction to balance on-road refinement with off-road durability. Engine options expanded to include 1.6-liter, 2.0-liter, and 2.5-liter V6 gasoline engines in most markets, with 1.9-liter and 2.0-liter diesel options in some regions. All variants maintained a proper four-wheel drive system with low-range gearing, though now with permanent four-wheel drive on many models rather than the selectable system of the previous generation. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and feature content, with available amenities including climate control, improved audio systems, and leather upholstery on higher trim levels. Safety features expanded to include dual front airbags, ABS brakes, and greater crash protection through improved body structure. This generation further developed the Vitara's positioning as a more premium compact SUV offering genuine off-road capability uncommon in its segment, finding particular success in markets where challenging road conditions or recreational off-roading were common considerations for buyers."

  - name: "Third Generation (JT/JB)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2015
    description: "The third-generation Suzuki Grand Vitara (with the 'Grand' prefix now standard in most markets) continued the model's evolution toward increased refinement and on-road performance while maintaining more off-road capability than most competitors in the compact SUV segment. Available in three-door and five-door body styles, though with the three-door discontinued in many markets before the end of the generation, the new Grand Vitara featured more upscale, sophisticated styling with a prominent chrome grille and integrated body cladding. This generation marked a return to a full unibody construction but with an integrated ladder frame for rigidity, maintaining a compromise between on-road comfort and off-road durability. Engine options varied by market but typically included 1.6-liter, 2.0-liter, and 2.4-liter four-cylinder and 2.7-liter V6 gasoline engines, with diesel options in some regions. All variants featured a full-time four-wheel drive system with a locking center differential and proper low-range gearing on most models, distinguishing it from the increasingly car-based competition. The interior represented a significant step forward with improved design, material quality, and technology, featuring available amenities including touchscreen navigation, premium audio systems, keyless entry and start, and enhanced safety features including multiple airbags, stability control, and improved crash structures. Throughout its long production run, this generation received various updates to styling, equipment, and powertrains, helping maintain its competitiveness in an increasingly crowded segment. The third-generation Grand Vitara successfully balanced improved on-road manners and comfort with continued off-road capability beyond most rivals, though as the market shifted increasingly toward car-based crossovers with limited off-road pretensions, it gradually became a more niche offering for buyers specifically seeking its combination of compact dimensions and genuine four-wheel drive capability."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (LY)"
    start_year: 2015
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth-generation Suzuki Vitara (dropping the 'Grand' prefix) represents a significant repositioning of the nameplate, transitioning from a compact off-road capable SUV to a more mainstream crossover focused primarily on on-road use. This strategic shift reflects broader market trends toward car-based crossovers with limited off-road aspirations but improved efficiency, driving dynamics, and technology. Available exclusively as a five-door model, the current Vitara features more contemporary, stylish design with a distinctive clamshell hood, two-tone paint options, and more aerodynamic proportions than its predecessors. Built on Suzuki's new-generation platform, this Vitara adopts a full unibody construction without the integrated ladder frame of previous generations, significantly reducing weight while improving rigidity, handling, and efficiency. Engine options vary by market and model year but typically include 1.0-liter and 1.4-liter Boosterjet turbocharged gasoline engines, 1.6-liter naturally aspirated gasoline engines in earlier years, and in some markets, 1.6-liter diesel options (discontinued in later years). A key innovation is the available mild hybrid system (SHVS) added in later model years, incorporating an integrated starter generator and lithium-ion battery to improve efficiency. Transmission options include five and six-speed manuals and six-speed automatic or CVT depending on market and engine. While standard models feature front-wheel drive, Suzuki's AllGrip four-wheel drive system is available on higher trim levels, offering multiple selectable modes but without the low-range gearing of previous generations. The interior offers a more modern design with a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system supporting Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on higher trims, improved materials, and available features including panoramic sunroof, adaptive cruise control, and various driver assistance systems. A 2018 facelift brought updated styling with a more prominent grille, revised interior elements, and improved safety technology including autonomous emergency braking. The fourth-generation Vitara successfully competes in the highly competitive compact crossover segment by combining distinctive styling, relatively efficient powertrains, and Suzuki's reputation for reliability in a package that offers more capability than many rivals when equipped with the AllGrip system, while acknowledging that most buyers in this segment prioritize on-road dynamics, efficiency, and technology over traditional off-road prowess."
